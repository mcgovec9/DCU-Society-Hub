# DCU-Society-Hub
Third Year Project

The system is a web based application that allows DCU’s various clubs and societies to have a central hub wherein committee members can
have all aspects of their club/society in the one place. From this web application they can: 

●	 Schedule committee meetings based around their respective timetables. This involves taking the timetable of each individual and
   comparing them to help find suitable slots to hold meetings. 
   
●	Have an updateable version of the member list which can be edited to add members. This will hold each societies members name, 
  student number and email. This will make it much easier to add club or society members onto lists for events.
  Can also be very useful during the clubs and socs week to neatly maintain all signups. 
  
●	Have a list of upcoming event dates for the club/society, with sign up functionality. This feature will work in conjunction with the
  member list. Allows you to sign-up members in a quick and easy fashion. 
  
●	Equipment management. Keeps track of societies equipment e.g what is currently available/unavailable, who is using what etc. 

●	Have a record of minutes from previous committee meetings. 

In our experience, most societies used a mix of other technologies such as excel, facebook and google docs to organise each aspect of their society.
Our system aims to eliminate the confusion that using different technologies can cause.
